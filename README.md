Go to the Chrome webstore : [CSS Used for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/css-used/cdopjfddjlonogibjahpnmjpoangjfff)

## Overview

Get all css rules used by the selected DOM and its children. Used to extrac only the used CSS. So the unused css will be left out.

If the selected DOM is the body, the result will be all the used css by the whole page curently.

## Usage

![How to use](http://ww2.sinaimg.cn/large/4e71f332gw1et7h0w4hxdg20i20go1kx.gif)

F12 open the Developer Tools, select the dom and active the "CSS Used" pannel. The used CSS rules of the Selected dom and its children's will be listed in the right textare.

You can click "Preview" to see the selected part with clean style rules.

## Known Limit

1. As for the CSS rule like `.wrap p{...}`, if only `<p>` is selected, the result `.wrap p{...}` may not apply directly to `<p>`.

 Either changing this rule's selector to `p{...}` or giving the `<p>` a `.wrap` parent in the final HTML.

2. If the selected `$0` has many children, especially when the page have many css rules, it can be a relatively long time to process with current tab freezed.

 The final result was generated by testing every rule on every element in the selected DOM. That's why it can be slow.
